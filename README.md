GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* WHEN I view the icon and image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order
